# CS361-Agile
Project for Team 19 Agile project for W2020 CS 361

This is a movie review website created as a semester long project for the Software Engineering I course at Oregon State University. 
The project was focused more towards learning and using the Agile method than producing a polished end result. As a team of five we worked in three, 2 week sprints.
For each section of the project we created and scheduled tasks based off of spikes and the scenarios and user stories that we generated during weekly team meetings.
